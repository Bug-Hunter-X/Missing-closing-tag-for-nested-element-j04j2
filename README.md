This repository demonstrates a common HTML error involving a missing closing tag for a nested element. The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version. This error can lead to unexpected rendering behaviors or validation failures in browsers. The solution involves simply adding the missing closing tag to ensure proper nesting and HTML structure.
